## What Mean RPA in IA

In the context of IA (Intelligent Automation), RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation. RPA is a technology that uses software robots, also known as bots, to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks within business processes. These bots mimic human interactions with digital systems, such as navigating through user interfaces, entering data, and performing tasks that traditionally require human intervention.

RPA is not inherently intelligent in the way that it doesn't possess cognitive capabilities or the ability to learn from experience like some other forms of artificial intelligence (AI). However, when combined with IA, which stands for Intelligent Automation, RPA can be integrated with AI technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing to enhance its capabilities.

Intelligent Automation seeks to combine the efficiency and speed of automation with the cognitive abilities of AI, allowing systems to handle more complex tasks, make decisions, and adapt to changing circumstances. In summary, within the broader field of IA, RPA plays a role in automating routine and repetitive tasks, contributing to overall efficiency and productivity.
