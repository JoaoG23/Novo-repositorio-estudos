##  Scraping what's mean

Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the HTML code of a web page and then extracting and collecting the desired information from it. Web scraping can be done manually, but it is more commonly performed using automated tools or scripts, often referred to as web scrapers or web crawling bots.

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts related to web scraping:

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** The structure of most web pages is written in HTML, a markup language that defines the structure and content of a webpage.

2. **Web Scraping:** This is the automated process of extracting information from websites. Web scraping tools navigate through the HTML structure of a webpage, locate the relevant data, and extract it for further use.

3. **Web Scraper or Bot:** A program or script designed to automate the web scraping process. These tools can simulate human browsing behavior to access and retrieve information from websites.

4. **Data Extraction:** The specific information or data that is targeted and collected during the web scraping process. This could include text, images, links, or any other content present on the web page.

Web scraping has various applications, including data mining, price monitoring, market research, and more. However, it's essential to note that not all websites permit scraping, and it's crucial to comply with the terms of service of a website and relevant legal regulations. Some websites may have restrictions or explicitly prohibit scraping activities to protect their data and ensure fair use. Always ensure that you have the right to scrape data from a particular website before doing so.
