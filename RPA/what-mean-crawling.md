Web crawling is like a computerized explorer:

Job: Its job is to visit websites.
How: It starts at one webpage, follows links to other pages, and keeps doing this.
Why: It helps search engines learn about and remember what's on the internet.
Think of it as: A robot reading and remembering information from different books on the library shelves.
Hope that makes it clearer! If you have more questions, feel free to ask.
