In your case, the issue is with the LIMIT 1 clause. Oracle does not support the LIMIT clause. If you want to update only one row, you need to make sure your WHERE clause is specific enough to match only one row.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your query:

```SQL

UPDATE DIP.PRESTADORES_SERVICO
SET TELEFONE='(19)1991-1999'
WHERE cpf = '1000000001' FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

```

This will update the telephone number of the first row where cpf equals **'1000000001'**.

Please note that if there are multiple rows with cpf equal to **'1000000001'**, this query will only update one of them arbitrarily. If you want to update a specific row, you should use a more precise WHERE clause.
