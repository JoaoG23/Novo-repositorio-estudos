The error message "Peer authentication failed for user 'postgres'" typically means that the PostgreSQL server is trying to use peer authentication (which matches operating system user names with database user names), but you're trying to connect as a database user that's different from your current operating system user.
Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:
- Switch to the postgres user before connecting to the database:

sudo su - postgres
psql

- Change the authentication method: You can change the authentication method from peer to md5 in the PostgreSQL configuration file (pg_hba.conf). Here's how:
    - Open the pg_hba.conf file. The location of this file depends on your PostgreSQL installation. On Ubuntu, it's typically located in the /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/ directory.

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf

- Find the line that looks like this:

local   all             postgres                                peer

- Change peer to md5:

local   all             postgres                                md5

- Save and close the file.
- Restart the PostgreSQL service:

sudo service postgresql restart

Now, you should be able to connect to the database using the postgres user and the password you set.
Please replace <version> with your actual PostgreSQL version.
Remember, these instructions are for a basic setup. Depending on your specific configuration, you might need to adjust these instructions. For more advanced usage, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation.
