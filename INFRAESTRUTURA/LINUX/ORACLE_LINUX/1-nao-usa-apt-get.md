The apt-get command is not found in Oracle Linux because it’s not a part of this distribution. Oracle Linux, like other Red Hat-based distributions, uses yum or dnf for package management, not apt-get1.

apt-get is a package management tool used by Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu2. If you’re familiar with using apt-get, you might find yum or dnf to be similar in many ways2.

If you need to install a package on Oracle Linux, you would typically use the yum or dnf command. For example, to install a package named example-package, you would use2:

    sudo yum install example-package

or

    sudo dnf install example-package

Please replace example-package with the name of the package you wish to install2.

Remember, always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information21.
